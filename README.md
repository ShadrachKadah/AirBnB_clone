0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
********************************


Description of the Project
------------------------
The AirBnB clone - The Console project is a command-line interface (CLI) implementation of a simplified 
version of the AirBnB booking platform. It provides functionality for managing and interacting with 
AirBnB-like objects such as users, places, amenities, reviews, and bookings. The console serves as a basic 
tool for performing various operations related to these objects, including creating, updating, deleting, 
and displaying them.

Description of the Command Interpreter
-------------------------------------
The command interpreter provides a text-based interface for interacting with the AirBnB clone application. 
It allows users to execute commands to perform operations on the available objects. These commands are designed to 
mimic the actions one might perform on the AirBnB website or app, such as creating users, adding places,
leaving reviews, and making bookings.
